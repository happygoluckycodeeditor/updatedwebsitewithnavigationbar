# updatedwebsitewithnavigationbar
Another Follow-up assignment for Responsive Web Design along with a navigation bar



Update 2023/2/19 :
1)Fixed the navigation bar to extend from border to border of the whole screen
2)Increased visibility of the menu options of the navigation by changing the font colour and also the hovering colour.
